# CryptoClustering

In this homework, we were tasked with figuring out the optimal number of clusters using the PCA Method and the KMeans Method.

I've concluded that in both methods, the optimal number of clusters is 4 because as seen on both elbow methods for them, the last number before the curve flattens is 4.

The final graphs show that the clusters both look similar, so it would be benficial to use less clusters to better visualize the data.

All the code used for this homework was created by me, using our past activities as a reference.
